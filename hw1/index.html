		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		We rasterize triangles by determining which pixels on a 2D screen are covered by the triangle and then
		filling in those pixels with the desired color. To begin, we define three points and a normal vector, 
		which are used for a given triangle. We then check the winding order of vertices to ensure they are in 
		a particular order, ensuring consistent orientation for future computations. Afterwards, we compute 
		the edges of the triangle and cross product between the normal vector and each edge vector, which are used
		to determine the orientation of sample points. The bounding box is subsequently calculated using the vertices
		of the triangle to minimize the number of pixels to be processed. We then iterate over each pixel in the
		bounding box, sampling the center point of the pixel and performing the in-triangle test using the dot product,
		filling in the pixel with the specified color if it passes the in-triangle test. This process is repeated until
		the image is appropriately colored. 

		My algorithm is not worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because it iterates
		through each pixel that's within the bounding box and only samples it once to determine whether it is in the triangle or not.
		In the worst case, the runtime is equal to the checking every sample in the triangle. 

		Here's an interesting part of test4.svg that shows how the edges of the blue triangle aren't entirely smooth and consistent.
		As seen from the image, there are places in the edge where they have a break of either one or two tiles.
